### Business Case

As a Covid 19 tracking measure, customers of 'Gastgewerbe' in Germany have to provide the 'Gastgewerbe' some personal information, such as:

- **phone number**
- **adress**
- **full name**

This is usually carried out with the help of preprinted forms (pen & paper).

This application aims to catapult 'Gastgewerbe' into the information era. By replacing the analog acquisition and management of customer data with digital means, 'Gastgewerbe' managers can save time and money. At the same time, 'Gastgewerbe' customers can opt for a much more convenient way of poviding their information.
