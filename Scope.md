### Business Case

As a Covid 19 tracking measure, customers of 'Gastgewerbe' in Germany have to provide the 'Gastgewerbe' some personal information, such as:

- **phone number**
- **adress**
- **full name**

This is usually carried out with the help of preprinted forms (pen & paper).

This application aims to catapult 'Gastgewerbe' into the information era. By replacing the analog acquisition and management of customer data with digital means, 'Gastgewerbe' managers can save time and money. At the same time, 'Gastgewerbe' customers are going to have a more comfortable experience at the 'Gastgewerbe'.

### Scope Management

Requirements shall be tracked in a table like so:

| ID  | Role     | Domain   | Importance | Description                                                                                                                                                    |
| --- | -------- | -------- | ---------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 01  | Customer | Security | High       | As customer, I want my personal information to stay undisclosed to everyone at all times, except to health authorities in case of a suspected case of Covid 19 |

The Description should be a user story.

---

4 roles are a given: **Customer**, **Developer**, **Owner** and **User**. By no means is this list complete. New roles may be added at any time.

| Role      | Description                                                                               |
| --------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Customer  | Customer of a 'Gastgewerbe'                                                               |
| Developer | Developer of this app                                                                     |
| Owner     | Manager in charge of a 'Gastgewerbe'                                                      |
| User      | User of the App, usually staff tasked with aquisition of customer data at a 'Gastgewerbe' |

Similarly, this list of domains is incomplete as well. However, assigning each requirement a domain is just a nice to have anyway.

| Domain      | Description                                       |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Security    | Everything related to protection of customer data |
| Feature     | Regarding a feature the app should provide        |
| Performance | Regarding the performance of a given Feature      |

---

Requirements can be identified, documented and updated continously.

### Requirements Register
